\title{Cluster DE genes by fold change from multiple files}
\usage{
clusterDEgenes(DEoutList, sampleNames, FDRcutoff = 0.05,
  method = "correlation", cut_cluster = NA, row_annotation = NULL,
  keepNAs = TRUE, outFile_prefix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{DEoutList}{A vector, with names of DESeq2 output files to use.}

\item{sampleNames}{Name of samples corresponding to the DESeq output file list.}

\item{FDRcutoff}{FDR cutoff to select DE genes from the list}

\item{method}{Which clustering method to use. "correlation" or "biclustering",
will allow output of gene names per cluster. Other methods are also supported
(all methods of hclust + kmeans), but won't output genes per cluster}

\item{cut_cluster}{A number to which the cluster dendrogram will be cut into
(NA means do not cut clusters)}

\item{row_annotation}{A data frame for the annotation of genes, with rownames
corresponding to the Row.names column of the DESeq2 output. The columns can have
annotations like chromosome, gene type etc..}

\item{keepNAs}{Many genes will have fold change = NA in some samples after merging,
since they are undetected in some samples. Select this if you want to still keep
those genes (NAs will be converted to zeros for clustering).}

\item{outFile_prefix}{A prefix for output files.}
}
\value{
A pdf with clustered heatmap, an .Rdata file with the hclust objects and the
genes sorted by clustered output, and text file with genes divided by clusters
(if cut_clusters is selected).
